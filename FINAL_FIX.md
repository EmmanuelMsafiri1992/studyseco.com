# üéØ FINAL FIX: The CORS errors confirm your .env is wrong!

## What the errors tell us:
- Your app is trying to load from `http://127.0.0.1:5173/@vite/client`
- This ONLY happens when `APP_ENV=local` or `APP_ENV=development`
- Your `.env` file is definitely NOT set to production

## ‚ö° DEFINITIVE COMMANDS (run on your server):

### Step 1: Check your current .env setting
```bash
cd /home/indegnnk/studyseco.com
grep APP_ENV .env
```
**This will likely show: `APP_ENV=local`**

### Step 2: Edit your .env file
```bash
nano .env
```

### Step 3: Change these lines in .env:
```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://studyseco.com
```

### Step 4: Save the file (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

### Step 5: Check your production assets exist
```bash
ls -la public/build/manifest.json
ls -la public/build/assets/ | head -5
```

### Step 6: Test immediately in browser
Visit `https://studyseco.com` - the CORS errors should disappear instantly.

## üîç What should happen after fixing .env:

**BEFORE (current):**
- Browser tries to load: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/@vite/client`
- CORS errors
- Development mode

**AFTER (correct):**
- Browser loads: `https://studyseco.com/build/assets/app-QMIXxiF2.js`
- No CORS errors
- Production mode

## üö® If it STILL doesn't work after changing .env:

1. **Clear browser cache completely**
2. **Check if you have multiple .env files**:
   ```bash
   find . -name ".env*" -type f
   ```
3. **Make sure you're editing the right .env**

## üí° Pro tip:
After changing .env, you can verify it worked by checking the page source. 
- **Wrong**: You'll see references to `127.0.0.1:5173`
- **Right**: You'll see references to `/build/assets/`

**This is 100% an environment configuration issue. The .env file is the only thing that needs to change.**
