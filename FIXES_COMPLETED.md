## ‚úÖ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fixed Notification Settings Issue

**Problem**: Notification settings link was not opening
**Root Cause**: Controller was rendering wrong Vue component path
**Solution**:
- Fixed `NotificationSettingsController.php` line 30
- Changed: `'Settings/Notifications'` ‚Üí `'Profile/NotificationSettings'`
- The Vue component exists at the correct path but controller was looking in wrong location

**Files Modified**:
- `C:\laragon\www\study\app\Http\Controllers\NotificationSettingsController.php`

### 2. Fixed Profile Picture Update Issue

**Problem**: Profile picture upload form was not functional
**Root Causes**: 
- Form had no submit functionality
- Controller didn't handle file uploads  
- Request validation missing profile photo rules

**Solutions**:

**A) Updated Vue Component** (`AccountSettings.vue`):
- Added proper Inertia form handling with `useForm()`
- Added file upload handler: `handleFileSelect()`
- Added form submission: `updateProfile()` method
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Added file type validation and size limits in UI

**B) Updated ProfileController**:
- Added file upload handling in `update()` method
- Added profile photo storage to `public/profile-photos/`
- Added old photo deletion when new one uploaded
- Added password hashing when password is updated
- Improved response with success message

**C) Updated ProfileUpdateRequest**:
- Added validation rules for `password` (nullable, min 8 chars)
- Added validation rules for `profile_photo` (image, max 2MB, specific formats)

**D) Database & Storage**:
- Profile photo column already existed in users table
- Created storage symlink for public access: `php artisan storage:link`

**Files Modified**:
- `C:\laragon\www\study\resources\js\Pages\Profile\AccountSettings.vue`
- `C:\laragon\www\study\app\Http\Controllers\ProfileController.php`
- `C:\laragon\www\study\app\Http\Requests\ProfileUpdateRequest.php`

## ‚úÖ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Profile Picture Upload Flow:
1. User selects image file (JPG, PNG, GIF up to 2MB)

4. Backend validates file type and size
5. Old profile photo deleted (if exists)
6. New photo stored in `storage/app/public/profile-photos/`
7. Database updated with new file path
8. User sees success message

### Notification Settings Flow:
1. User clicks "Notification Settings" in sidebar
2. Route `/notification-settings` loads properly
3. Controller renders `Profile/NotificationSettings` Vue component
4. Page displays sound settings and notification preferences
5. All interactive elements functional (toggles, test buttons)
