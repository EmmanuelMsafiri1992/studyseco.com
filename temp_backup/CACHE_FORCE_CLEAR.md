# üîß Your .env is correct, but Laravel has cached the old config!

## Problem Analysis:
- ‚úÖ Your `.env` shows `APP_ENV=production` 
- ‚ùå But browser still tries to load `127.0.0.1:5173` (development assets)
- **Cause**: Laravel has cached the old configuration when it was `APP_ENV=local`

## ‚ö° FORCE CLEAR ALL CACHES (Run on your server):

### Step 1: Manual cache clearing (bypass the artisan error)
```bash
# Remove ALL cached files manually
rm -rf bootstrap/cache/*
rm -rf storage/framework/cache/data/*
rm -rf storage/framework/views/*
rm -rf storage/framework/sessions/*
```

### Step 2: Check if production assets exist
```bash
# These files MUST exist for production mode
ls -la public/build/manifest.json
ls -la public/build/assets/app-*.js
ls -la public/build/assets/app-*.css
```

### Step 3: If assets are missing, that's the problem!
```bash
# Check if build directory exists
ls -la public/build/
```

### Step 4: Test with a simple PHP script
Create a test file to see what environment Laravel actually sees:
```bash
echo '<?php require "vendor/autoload.php"; $app = require_once "bootstrap/app.php"; echo "ENV: " . $app->environment(); ?>' > test-env.php
php test-env.php
```

### Step 5: Force reload by touching .env
```bash
touch .env
```

### Step 6: Restart web server (if possible)
```bash
# If you have access to restart Apache/Nginx:
sudo systemctl reload apache2
# OR
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## üéØ Expected Results:

After clearing caches:
- `test-env.php` should show: `ENV: production`
- Browser should load: `https://studyseco.com/build/assets/...`
- No more `127.0.0.1:5173` requests

## üö® If assets are missing:
If `public/build/` is empty or missing, you need to upload the production build:
- Upload the entire `public/build/` folder from your local machine
- This contains all the compiled assets (1.4MB of files)

**The .env is correct, now we need to force Laravel to see the change!**
