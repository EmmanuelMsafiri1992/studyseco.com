● You're absolutely right! That's poor UX - a logged-in student shouldn't be redirected to a landing page to extend their access. They should be able to extend directly from within the dashboard.

  Let me check what's happening in the ExtensionController that's causing this redirect:

● Read(app\Http\Controllers\ExtensionController.php)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I found the issue! On line 20, the controller redirects to route('welcome') when no enrollment is found. This is sending logged-in students to the landing page, which is terrible UX.

  Instead, logged-in students should either:
  1. Be allowed to create a new enrollment from within the dashboard, or
  2. Be shown a proper dashboard page explaining they need to enroll first

  Let me fix this by redirecting to the dashboard instead of the welcome page:

● Update(app\Http\Controllers\ExtensionController.php)
  ⎿  Updated app\Http\Controllers\ExtensionController.php with 1 addition and 1 removal
       17            $enrollment = $user->enrollments()->with('payments')->first();
       18
       19            if (!$enrollment) {
       20 -              return redirect()->route('welcome')->with('error', 'No active enrollment found.');
       20 +              return redirect()->route('dashboard')->with('error', 'You need to enroll in a course first before you can extend access. Please contact support if you need assistance with enrollment.');
       21            }
       22
       23            // Calculate extension pricing based on user's currency
above is where we ended


when the user has selected free 7days trial
they must not be able to see the following:
 Cancellation Policy:

• 14-day cooling period: Cancel within 14 days for full refund via same payment method
• Refund processing: 24-48 hours after cancellation approval
• No pausing: Course access cannot be paused once started
• Material policy: Resources are for personal use only, not downloadable or shareable outside the platform

since they are not paying anything hence it does not make sense for them to see about refund or cancellation. only users who
are paying must be able to see it.

also on Data Usage: Approximately 2-3GB monthly for optimal learning experience. i think 7 to 10gb will be correct approximation per
month.

on the landing page night schools are those schools which offers afternoon classes better called open school.
