● You're absolutely right! That's poor UX - a logged-in student shouldn't be redirected to a landing page to extend their access. They should be able to extend directly from within the dashboard.

  Let me check what's happening in the ExtensionController that's causing this redirect:

● Read(app\Http\Controllers\ExtensionController.php)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I found the issue! On line 20, the controller redirects to route('welcome') when no enrollment is found. This is sending logged-in students to the landing page, which is terrible UX.

  Instead, logged-in students should either:
  1. Be allowed to create a new enrollment from within the dashboard, or
  2. Be shown a proper dashboard page explaining they need to enroll first

  Let me fix this by redirecting to the dashboard instead of the welcome page:

● Update(app\Http\Controllers\ExtensionController.php)
  ⎿  Updated app\Http\Controllers\ExtensionController.php with 1 addition and 1 removal
       17            $enrollment = $user->enrollments()->with('payments')->first();
       18
       19            if (!$enrollment) {
       20 -              return redirect()->route('welcome')->with('error', 'No active enrollment found.');
       20 +              return redirect()->route('dashboard')->with('error', 'You need to enroll in a course first before you can extend access. Please contact support if you need assistance with enrollment.');
       21            }
       22
       23            // Calculate extension pricing based on user's currency
