● Excellent! I have successfully completed all the requested fixes for the payment system:

  Summary of Changes

  1. ✅ Fixed Payment Creation Layout: Redesigned the payment creation page to use an ultra-compact single-card layout that eliminates all scrolling issues. The form now fits on a single screen with:
    - Compact header with payment history link
    - Three-column layout for Access Duration, Payment Method, and Payment Details
    - Inline instructions and submit section
  2. ✅ Added Location-Based Payment Method Filtering: Implemented proper filtering so users only see relevant payment methods:
    - South African users see South African and international payment methods
    - Malawian users see Malawian and international payment methods
    - Updated Vue component to use the correct 'code' field instead of 'key'
    - Fixed payment instructions to use the model's account_details attribute
  3. ✅ Fixed 403 Permission Error: Resolved the "403 Access denied. Insufficient permissions" error by:
    - Removing the middleware('role:admin') restriction from the payments index route
    - The PaymentController already has proper logic to show admin view for admins and student payment history for students
    - Updated payment method references from 'key' to 'code' throughout the system

  All payment system issues have been resolved. Students can now:
  - Access the payment creation page without excessive scrolling
  - Only see payment methods relevant to their location
  - View their payment history without permission errors

> under extension a student must be able to extend also with the number of subjects in case he or she enrolled only 2subjects, a student must be able to extend to more subject and they must be able to pay for the additional subjects and
  also the system must show country names with logo of where the registered student is located.

● I'll help you implement extension functionality for students to add more subjects and display country information with flags. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation:
