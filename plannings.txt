- students must be able to see the subjects completed
- teachers must be able to see the total support completed
- even the adding must able to be able to see the total support completed
- login page must have simar design like frontend and even much better and professional with a logo appearing too.
- on the landing page add a section to professionally guide a visitor on how the who system works by showing all the functionalities for a student to learn and enjoy and not forgetting also make it very innovative such that a student must find it very better and easy to use.
dont forget to remind them that they will only learn everything online and once done, they must choose any 5 preferred centers where they wish to sit for exams physically.
- also make mention that if the student is abroad they must be able to choose a center and be available at least 2weeks before exam dates.
- on the landing page also add all the list of Malawian secondary schools which supports open students to sit for exams in Malawi they are called night schools thats community day secondary schools and full government secondary schools. only list schools which can allow one to sit for exams not big private schools like marrymout or Maranatha. make sure these schools are professionally displayed on the landing page.
- also when students have loggedin, they must be able to see the list of secondary schools and be able to choose where to sit for exams. they must choose atleast 5schools so that incase one school has refused we can help them to another.
- when students have loggedin, remember they are only allowed to access the materials for a certain duration and until then, if the time has passed they must lose access unless they extent the course which ofcourse means payment new money. a student also must be able to extend even before the course expires. for example if the student enrolled in 4 month course access but then realized that they need more that, they can extend by adding new months and the system must be able to show them the total amount to pay.
- also on the payment methods I see that once the student has loggedin, he or she is not able to click on any payment method please fix this and also redesign the structure so that they are all alight perfectly fine.
- I noted that on mobile screen such buttons are looking so big not attractive at all. please implement the whole system to be mobile friendly whenever the use clicks anything they must see everything clearly as though they were on desktop because remember such students does not have a laptop hence they must be able to use the system without any issues.
- on the frontend, also show students roughly how much data they need to use the system monthly so that they know if they can manage learning or not.
- also on enrolment I noted that students can enrol even without ticking the terms and conditions, this must be fixed. the student must read and understand terms and conditions and agreed before proceeding. and on terms and conditions please add that "once the student has loggedin to the portal, he can cancel the training only within the first 14days period and once cancelled they will be refunded their money within 24 to 48hrs via the same payment method they used and must be able to see the refund status on their portal. This means if the student has access to our materials for more than 14days then they will not be allowed to cancel. another thing is that once they have enrolled the training they will not be allowed to pause it until their total duration. also mention interms and conditions that materials are not downloadable and sharable anywhere except only inside the system with fellow students.
- add an AI model that can be training by the admin by uploading into books and past papers for each and every subject and syllabus such that when students needs subject based questions, the AI must be able to respond however if they AI cannot help, they must be able to book live session with their assigned tutor. and when they loggin the student must be able to see the name and contact of the assigned tutor. and the admin must be able to assign a teacher with students.

- a teacher must be able to see the list of the students assigned to him and must be able to get in touch with them right inside the system.
- on notifications I needed that when you visit some pages and you try to click on notifications, the page does not take you anywhere, this must be fixed.
- when the student have loggedin, under "Recent Activities" students must not be able to system payment details paid by others, they must only see what is related to them.
- also notification sounds when there is a new notication students must be able to hear the sound, and also under their account settings they must be able to choose either to enable or disable the notification sounds.
- in the teacher dashboard the teacher must be able to see the calendar and book a meeting with students and also he must be able to upload his teaching and reference materials, a section for teach creating lesson plans, notes and many more so that the teacher does not have to use hard copies for planning.
- in the admin panel the admin panel add the audit trail that will be able to log every activity of every user for system security.
- under achievements I want each person to be able to see what he or she has achieve so far and the admin must be able to see all the peoples achievements. and also for students once completed studies can achieve certificate of completions, also when they are taking much time watching videos must achieve hardwork and be encouraged and they must all be notified.
- under http://127.0.0.1:8000/payments I must be able to see the real data and be able to approve and  reject payments
-  under Active Enrollments and Monthly Revenue I need the real data not sample data in the dashboard.
- also admin settings I must be able to see the preferred currency to see to it means ther is a need to implement a currency changing logic such that when you choose Malawian Kwachas, all the different payment currencies must be converted to kwacha based on the rate you have set so that you are able to see the correct revenue made.
- under Active Enrollments on http://127.0.0.1:8000/reports I need the actual data not sample.
